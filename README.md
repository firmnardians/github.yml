I was a backseat driver, scared to steer my head clean
Like a state speech champ too afraid to speak
I didn’t know who I was or where to be
And it went on, and it went on, on and on

I was a good-guy huckster, stuck without a con
A tenor in the choir that couldn’t sing out loud
A two-faced liar seeking honest love
And it went on, and it went on, on and on

You turned me around, now we’re building a home
And filling it up with stills from long ago
Growing a garden of nights and of mornings
And it goes on, and it goes on, on and on

Wherever else we go
We’ll still be running around Rome
Wherever else we go
We’ll still be running together

Throughout every iteration
Despite every dumb point of view
Even though my lacking conversation
Embarrassess me and you
We’re building up our house of past lives
I hold each one a little too tight
And it goes on, and it goes on, on and on
